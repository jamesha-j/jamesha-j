<h1>Hi, I'm Jamesha!</h1>

<b> I'm an aspiring analyst currently working on side projects to improve my database management and data manipulation techniques. 
I hold an Associate's in Computer Technology (August 2025) and a Bachelor's in Business Marketing(2018). This blend of technical and business skills allows me to understand business objectives and how to manipulate data.<b>

<b>Currently, I work as a Data Quality Specialist at a healthcare tech company, where I assist with data entry, credentialing processes, and implementation support. Through this role I've continued to master my attention to detail and understanding of data governance standards. I am actively expanding my technical skills through self directed projects focused on SQL, Python, and Power BI, and I am eager to transition into a full time Analyst role where I can apply these skills to solve complex business problems.
